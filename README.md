# Static Adversarial Tradecraft Repository (SATR)

I'm renaming this project because I'm readying to release the Dynamic Tradecraft Repository which was completely re-written
in Java (although there is a Python-based POC --maybe something to explore later).  

This project was born out of the need to stop collecting TTP's in text files and random places.  This interface was written 
in Python and converted to an executable with pyinstaller.

Download the EXE and the XLS.  The EXE will read the XLS file and populate the interface.  

There are a few ascii encoding bugs in the UI as it attempts to read the XLS file contents.  
It's actually kind of a pain, but I will work through these as I find them.  

You can also let me know if you come across them.
