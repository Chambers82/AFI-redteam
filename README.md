This interface was written in Python and converted to an executable with pyinstaller.  

Download the EXE and the XLS.  The EXE will read the XLS file and populate the interface.  

There are a view unicode bugs in the XLS file.  I will work through these as I find them. 
You can also let me know if you come across them.
